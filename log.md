### Day 1: 2020-08-09

**Today's Progress**: Experimented with Twitch API / read the docs / made a widget in Vue.

**Thoughts**: Vue <3 - struggled with fetch() headers for a while. Messed with oAuth a bit.

**Link(s) to ~~work~~ docs**: [dev.twitch.tv](https://dev.twitch.tv/)

### Day 2: 2020-08-10

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a little PHP backend. It consumes a csv of users and negotiates client-side access to a page.

**Thoughts**: `null`

**Link(s) to work**: `null`

### Day 3: 2020-08-11

**Today's Progress**: Continued on that one ðŸ‘† :) (NDA, sorry it's boring)

### Day 4: 2020-08-12

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with Twitch API stuff, at 4:10am, because I couldn't sleep. I added some environment checking. BG is transparent in prod and `#000` in dev (so I can see it)

**Thoughts**: `null`

**Link(s) to work**: I have decided I'll make it public, but I've gotta clean it up _a little_ first.

### Day 5: 2020-08-13

**Today's Progress**: Working on a nuxt.js project for work. Axios request for some data, then gently massage it using `map`, `reduce` and `filter`. 

**Thoughts**: Need to break components into smaller pieces. These components were starting to get messy and unwieldy over time. 

**Link(s) to work**: `null`

### Day 6: 2020-08-14

**Today's Progress**: Continuing on the nuxt.js project. Lots of debugging.

**Thoughts**: I moved some of the complicated logic into a jest/spec vanilla js file, and mocked the response, instead of waiting for Axios. This made it easier to work on getting the data "massage" correct.

**Link(s) to work**: `null`

### Day 7: 2020-08-17

**Today's Progress**: I took the weekend off. Today I got back up to speed on the backend, and messed around with cookies some more, before I ended up with a gnarly headache and had to take a break.

**Thoughts**: Some of the legacy code is a bit "spaghetti", so this job might benefit from working in a sandbox away from some of the dependent code as well.
